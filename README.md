Air Quality Analysis Report: PM2.5 in Houston (2023) By Chisom Mbah

Project Overview This project analyzes daily PM2.5 air pollution levels in Houston, Texas, during the year 2023. PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers) is an important indicator of air quality, impacting human health and the environment.

Data Source The data was sourced from the EPA AirData portal, containing daily PM2.5 measurements recorded at monitoring stations across Houston throughout 2023.

Data Preparation Loaded the dataset and converted date columns to datetime format.

Cleaned missing values by removing records without PM2.5 data.

Added additional columns for month and day of the week to explore temporal patterns.

Exploratory Data Analysis Daily Trends: Visualized daily PM2.5 levels across the year, showing fluctuations and spikes.
Monthly Averages: Identified which months had the highest and lowest average PM2.5 concentrations.

Weekly Patterns: Compared average PM2.5 levels by day of the week to see if weekdays differ from weekends.

Results / Findings “The average monthly PM2.5 concentrations in Houston during 2023 varied throughout the year. The highest average levels were observed in July (20.7 µg/m³), indicating a period of increased air pollution. The lowest averages occurred in February (10.8 µg/m³). Daily PM2.5 data revealed several spikes, with the most significant peak occurring around mid-July. This suggests that air quality tends to worsen during the summer months.”
Discussion “The elevated PM2.5 levels in July could be attributed to higher temperatures that increase the formation of secondary pollutants and possibly increased industrial activity or wildfires in the region. Such elevated particulate matter poses health risks, particularly to children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions. Understanding these patterns can guide local authorities in implementing timely air quality advisories and pollution control measures.”.

Conclusion: “In summary, Houston experienced higher PM2.5 pollution in summer 2023, highlighting seasonal air quality challenges. Continued monitoring and mitigation efforts are essential to protect public health.”
